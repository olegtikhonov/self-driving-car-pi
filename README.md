The road will be as a NÃ¼rburgring race track. The driverless car should pass it.

## Day one
Today, 26 of December 2019 I've got a package from Amazon. Smart Sensor Car Kit. Lovely staff was a motto "Make it easy & Make it Fun". We will check it out soon how easy it is.

## Day two - Building the Car
Today, 02-02-2020 is a perfect day to start building a PI-car.
The car equipped with three sensor modules:

Here a list of what I'm going to assemble:
  * Front Half chassis;
  * Front Wheels;
  * Steering Part;
  * Upper Plate;
  * Battery Holder;
  * Rear Wheels (screws)
